I want you to edit specific areas of this interior design image.
The areas to change are described by their position in the image:

{edit_instructions}

Rules:
- Apply ONLY the specified changes to the described areas
- Keep all other elements exactly as they are
- Preserve room architecture, camera angle, and lighting direction
- Blend edits naturally with the surrounding environment

Your output image MUST be a clean photorealistic photograph — the kind a
homeowner would show to friends or post online. No overlays, markers, text,
circles, numbers, or any annotation-like shapes.
