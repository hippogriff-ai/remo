This interior design image has numbered colored circles marking areas to change.
Each numbered circle indicates a specific region and edit instruction:

{edit_instructions}

Rules:
- Apply ONLY the specified changes to the marked areas
- Keep all unmarked elements exactly as they are
- Preserve room architecture, camera angle, and lighting direction
- Blend edits naturally with the surrounding environment

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT — READ THIS CAREFULLY:
Your output image MUST be a clean photorealistic photograph. It must look like
a real photograph a homeowner would hang on a wall or show to friends.

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT reproduce ANY of the following in your output:
- Colored circles (red, blue, green, or any color)
- Numbered badges or labels
- Outlines, markers, or any annotation overlays
- Any visual element that looks like a UI overlay or markup

The colored circles and numbered badges in the INPUT are edit instructions ONLY.
They tell you WHERE to make changes. They are NOT part of the room. They must
NEVER appear in your generated output image. If your output contains any circles,
numbers, or annotation-like shapes, you have FAILED the task.

Your output = realistic interior design photograph. Nothing else.
