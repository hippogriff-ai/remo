This interior design image has numbered colored circles marking areas to change.
Each numbered circle indicates a specific region and edit instruction:

{edit_instructions}

Rules:
- Apply ONLY the specified changes to the marked areas
- Keep all unmarked elements exactly as they are
- Preserve room architecture, camera angle, and lighting direction
- Blend edits naturally with the surrounding environment

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Your output image must be a clean photorealistic
photograph with ZERO visual annotations. Do NOT include any circles, numbers,
badges, outlines, or markers in your output. If you see colored circles or
numbered badges in the input, those are edit instructions ONLY — they must NOT
appear in your generated image. The output must look like a real photograph.
