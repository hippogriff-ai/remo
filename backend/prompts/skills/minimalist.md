# Minimalist & Intentional Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: Monochromatic or very limited — white, warm gray, black, one muted accent maximum
- **Furniture**: Architectural pieces that function as sculpture — every piece earns its place
- **Storage**: Hidden — no visible clutter, built-in solutions, closed cabinets, concealed systems
- **Space**: Negative space is intentional — emptiness is a design element, not a gap to fill
- **Materials**: High-quality over quantity — one excellent material > three mediocre ones
- **Forms**: Precise geometric — clean edges, consistent proportions, mathematical relationships

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Single statement sofa — clean lines, no decorative pillows (2 max, matching)
- One coffee table, one side table — geometric, quality material (marble, solid wood, steel)
- Art: one large piece OR a disciplined gallery wall (consistent frames, geometric arrangement)
- Lighting: recessed flush-mount or architectural — fixtures as invisible as possible
- Nothing on the floor except furniture and one rug
- Remote controls, books, magazines — all in concealed storage

### Bedroom
- Platform bed with clean lines — ideally integrated nightstands or wall-mounted shelves
- Bedding: single color, crisp and structured, minimal pillows (2-4)
- Closet system instead of visible wardrobe/dresser
- One bedside light per side — flush-mount or architectural wall sconce
- Empty nightstand tops except for lamp and one object

### Kitchen
- Handle-less cabinetry — push-to-open, integrated pulls, or continuous channel
- All countertop appliances stored away — zero items on counters when not in use
- Single material countertop — continuous, no tile or mixed materials
- Integrated or concealed hood
- Minimal open shelving — if present, precisely curated

### Home Office
- Floating desk or slim desk with cable management (zero visible cables)
- Single monitor setup — wall-mounted preferred
- Closed storage for all office supplies
- One plant, one desk lamp, nothing else visible
- Chair stored under desk when not in use

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Low profile, track arms or armless, single neutral color, no pattern, architectural legs
- **Coffee table**: Single material — marble slab, solid wood block, glass + steel, nothing decorative
- **Dining table**: Monolith style — solid surface, clean edge, geometric base
- **Lighting**: Recessed, flush-mount, or concealed — the less visible the fixture, the better
- **Rug**: Solid color, flat-weave, clean edge — defines the zone without adding visual noise

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO apply the "subtract until it breaks" principle — remove items until the room stops functioning, then add one thing back
- DO invest in quality for the few pieces you keep — each item is scrutinized more in spare spaces
- DO hide everything that doesn't intentionally contribute to the design (remotes, chargers, mail, etc.)
- DO use consistent materials and finishes throughout — repetition creates calm
- DO let architecture and light be the primary design elements
- DON'T confuse minimalist with empty — every item present is intentional, not absent
- DON'T add "pops of color" — minimalism is about discipline, not decoration
- DON'T use multiple materials where one will do (e.g., one countertop material, not tile + marble + wood)
- DON'T leave dust collectors — each visible item needs regular justification

## Common Blends
- **Minimalist + Modern**: Near-identical — minimalist is modern taken to its logical extreme. Modern allows slightly more decorative objects and color accents.
- **Minimalist + Scandinavian**: "Warm minimal" — blonde wood adds warmth, one or two plants soften the space, hygge textiles (sheepskin, one knit throw) prevent coldness.
- **Minimalist + Luxurious**: "Quiet luxury" — fewer pieces, each exquisite. One marble surface, one cashmere throw, one statement light. Restraint amplifies material quality.
- **Minimalist + Calm**: Shared philosophy of reduction — calm adds muted color (sage, lavender) and soft textures where minimalist tends toward hard surfaces and monochrome.

## Probing Steps
After loading this skill, ask these style-specific questions (pick 2-3 most relevant to the room):
1. "How strict should the minimalism be — comfortable minimal or gallery-level sparse?"
2. "Would you like one accent color or stay purely monochromatic?"
3. "Is hidden storage essential — built-ins, concealed systems — or just fewer visible items?"
4. "Are you comfortable with empty surfaces and walls, or does that feel too cold?"

## Example Partial Brief

**User said:** "Less is more — I want to see nothing but the essentials, everything else hidden away. The space itself should be the feature."
