# Bohemian & Eclectic Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: Saturated warm colors + rich jewel accents — burnt orange, deep teal, magenta, gold, terracotta
- **Pattern**: Mixed global patterns — kilim, ikat, suzani, block print, batik, Moroccan tile
- **Textiles**: Layered everywhere — floor cushions, wall tapestries, draped fabrics, poufs, throws
- **Seating**: Low — floor cushions, poufs, daybeds, low-slung sofas, hammock chairs
- **Materials**: Natural + handmade — macrame, rattan, bamboo, hand-thrown pottery, hand-woven textiles
- **Plants**: Abundant — trailing, hanging, potted, climbing, terrariums, dried flowers
- **Lighting**: Warm ambient — string lights, lanterns, candles, warm-toned fabric shade lamps (2200-2700K)

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Kilim or vintage rug as the anchor — bold pattern, warm colors
- Low sofa or daybed with an abundance of mixed-pattern throw pillows
- Floor cushions and poufs for additional seating
- Macrame wall hanging or woven textile art
- Plants at multiple heights — hanging, shelf, floor, windowsill
- String lights or lantern lighting for warm ambient glow
- Stacked books, collected objects, travel souvenirs as decor

### Bedroom
- Canopy or draped fabric above bed (tapestry, sheer, macrame)
- Layered bedding — mixed patterns in complementary warm tones
- Low bed frame or mattress on platform
- Gallery wall of mixed art, photos, and objects
- Trailing plants on shelves and nightstands
- Warm string lights or lantern-style bedside lamps
- Woven or rattan storage baskets

### Kitchen
- Open shelving with eclectic dishware collection
- Hand-painted tiles (Moroccan, Portuguese, Mexican) as backsplash
- Hanging plants above sink or in windows
- Woven and ceramic storage (jars, baskets, pottery)
- Patterned runner rug in front of sink
- Collected vintage kitchen objects on display

### Home Office
- Rattan or vintage desk
- Gallery wall of inspiration — mixed frames, postcards, textiles, objects
- Lots of plants around desk area
- Patterned rug under desk
- Woven baskets for storage
- Eclectic lighting — vintage desk lamp, string lights

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Low-slung, deep, in a warm jewel tone or natural linen, mixed pattern cushions
- **Coffee table**: Carved wood, brass tray table, or vintage trunk
- **Seating**: Floor cushions, poufs (Moroccan leather, kilim-covered), hammock chair, rattan peacock chair
- **Lighting**: Moroccan lanterns, string lights, beaded chandeliers, paper lanterns, candle clusters
- **Rug**: Vintage kilim, Persian, or bold patterned — layered rugs encouraged

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO mix patterns fearlessly — the key is keeping a consistent color temperature (all warm OR all cool undertones)
- DO layer textiles at every opportunity — rugs on rugs, throws on pillows, tapestries on walls
- DO include handmade and collected objects — each piece should have a story or origin
- DO let plants take over — more is more in boho plant life
- DO mix furniture from different eras, origins, and materials
- DON'T match — boho is deliberately un-coordinated (coordinated looks "catalog," not "collected")
- DON'T use mass-produced identical decor sets — authenticity is essential
- DON'T use cool lighting (>3000K) — boho needs warm, diffused, romantic light
- DON'T leave walls bare — if not art or textiles, then floating shelves with objects and plants

## Common Blends
- **Bohemian + Cozy**: Maximalist warmth — shared love of layering, textiles, and warm light. Boho adds color and pattern; cozy adds depth and refuge.
- **Bohemian + Rustic**: "Collected cabin" — natural materials from both styles combine. Reclaimed wood + global textiles + handmade pottery + abundant plants.
- **Bohemian + Modern**: "Boho-modern" — clean-line furniture as a neutral canvas for bold textiles and pattern. Edited boho — fewer pieces, more impact.
- **Bohemian + Luxurious**: "Boho glam" — velvet and brass mixed with kilim and macrame. Jewel tones bridge both styles. Moroccan poufs + gold-framed mirrors.

## Probing Steps
After loading this skill, ask these style-specific questions (pick 2-3 most relevant to the room):
1. "How layered should it feel — edited boho or full maximalist?"
2. "Do you have specific travel or cultural influences you'd like represented?"
3. "How much plant life — a few accents or a full indoor jungle?"
4. "Are you OK with floor seating (cushions, poufs) or do you need all traditional seating?"
