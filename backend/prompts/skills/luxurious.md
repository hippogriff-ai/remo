# Luxurious & Refined Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Fabrics**: Rich — velvet, silk, leather (full-grain), cashmere, heavy brocade
- **Accents**: Marble and brass — veined marble surfaces, brushed or polished brass hardware and fixtures
- **Furniture**: Statement custom pieces — curved forms, tufted upholstery, sculptural silhouettes
- **Lighting**: Chandeliers and layered dramatic lighting — crystal, multi-arm, dimmable
- **Millwork**: Crown molding, decorative paneling, coffered ceilings where possible
- **Palette**: Jewel tones (emerald, sapphire, ruby) OR sophisticated deep neutrals (charcoal, chocolate, navy)

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Statement sofa in velvet (emerald, navy, or deep neutral) with tufted or sculpted back
- Marble-top coffee table or side table with brass base
- Crystal or multi-arm chandelier as focal point
- Heavy silk or velvet curtains, floor-to-ceiling, with decorative hardware
- Gold or brass-framed mirror (oversized) to amplify drama
- Art: large-scale, gallery-style with proper lighting (picture lights or spots)

### Bedroom
- Upholstered headboard in velvet or leather (tall, tufted, or channeled)
- Silk or high-thread-count cotton bedding, multiple decorative layers
- Matching nightstands in high-quality wood or lacquered finish with brass pulls
- Chandelier or statement pendant as bedroom focal point (dimmable)
- Thick area rug in wool or silk blend

### Dining Room
- Statement chandelier over table (30-36" above surface, oversized for drama)
- Upholstered dining chairs in velvet or leather
- High-quality wood or marble table
- Brass or gold candlestick holders as table centerpiece
- Credenza or sideboard in rich wood with brass hardware

### Kitchen
- Marble or quartzite countertops with dramatic veining
- Brass or gold cabinet hardware and fixtures
- Statement range hood as architectural feature
- Glass-front upper cabinets with interior lighting for display
- Bar cart with crystal glassware

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Velvet or full-grain leather, curved or tufted, brass or gold legs
- **Coffee table**: Marble top with brass base, or lacquered wood with brass inlay
- **Dining table**: Walnut or mahogany with brass detailing, or marble slab
- **Lighting**: Crystal chandelier, brass multi-arm fixture, marble base table lamps, picture lights
- **Rug**: Silk blend, Persian-inspired, or deep solid wool — rich color, dense pile

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO invest in quality materials — real marble, genuine leather, solid brass (not plated)
- DO use dramatic lighting as a design element (chandelier, cove lighting, picture lights)
- DO mix metals deliberately — brass dominant with silver/chrome as secondary accent only
- DO include one "hero piece" that anchors the room (statement sofa, chandelier, art piece)
- DO layer rich textures — velvet against silk against leather against marble
- DON'T fake it — faux marble, plastic gold, vinyl "leather" undermines the luxury intent
- DON'T over-gild — luxury is about restraint and quality, not covering everything in gold
- DON'T use builder-grade fixtures or hardware (they undercut the entire concept)
- DON'T ignore proportion — oversized furniture in a small room feels cramped, not grand

## Common Blends
- **Luxurious + Modern**: "Glam modern" — marble, brass, velvet in clean architectural forms. No ornate curves — sculptural and refined.
- **Luxurious + Cozy**: "Rich warmth" — deep jewel velvet, layered throws, brass warm lighting. Intimate and opulent.
- **Luxurious + Minimalist**: "Quiet luxury" — fewer pieces but each is exquisite. Monochromatic with one rich material (marble, cashmere). Negative space amplifies each object.
- **Luxurious + Bohemian**: "Boho glam" — kilim rugs with brass tables, velvet poufs, eclectic global art with gold frames. More is more, but every piece has weight.

## Probing Steps
After loading this skill, ask these style-specific questions (pick 2-3 most relevant to the room):
1. "Do you lean toward jewel tones (emerald, sapphire) or sophisticated neutrals (charcoal, navy)?"
2. "Is a statement chandelier or dramatic light fixture something you'd want as a focal point?"
3. "How do you feel about marble — love it for surfaces, or prefer warm wood?"
4. "Are you going for 'boutique hotel' or more 'classic estate' in feel?"

## Example Partial Brief

**User said:** "I want it to feel like a high-end hotel suite — dramatic lighting, rich materials, sophisticated but not gaudy."
