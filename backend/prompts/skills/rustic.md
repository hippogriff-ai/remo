# Rustic & Natural Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Wood**: Reclaimed, distressed, or rough-hewn — character imperfections are features, not flaws
- **Metal**: Wrought iron, blackened steel, aged copper — matte finishes, no polish
- **Stone**: Natural stone surfaces — slate, fieldstone, river rock, rough-cut granite
- **Textiles**: Woven natural fibers — jute, burlap, linen, raw cotton, wool
- **Palette**: Earth tones — brown, forest green, rust, ochre, cream, charcoal
- **Lighting**: Warm filament-style (2200K), lanterns, wrought iron fixtures, candle-inspired
- **Objects**: Handcrafted, artisanal, one-of-a-kind — pottery, woven baskets, carved wood

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Reclaimed wood accent wall or exposed beam ceiling if possible
- Deep, comfortable sofa in natural linen or worn leather
- Solid wood coffee table — live edge, farmhouse, or industrial reclaimed
- Wrought iron or wood-and-iron light fixtures
- Stone fireplace surround as focal point (or rustic mantel display)
- Layered textiles: jute area rug, wool throw, linen pillows

### Bedroom
- Wood bed frame — reclaimed barn wood, log, or simple solid wood with visible grain
- Natural linen bedding in earth tones, layered with wool or knit blankets
- Wrought iron bedside lamps or wooden lantern-style fixtures
- Woven basket storage for blankets and pillows
- Nature-inspired art — botanical prints, landscape photography, pressed botanicals

### Kitchen
- Open shelving in reclaimed wood for everyday dishes
- Butcher block or natural stone countertops
- Farmhouse sink (apron front)
- Wrought iron pot rack or hanging hooks
- Mason jars and ceramic canisters for storage display
- Pendant lights in metal cage or wood-and-iron design

### Home Office
- Solid wood desk — live edge or farmhouse style
- Leather desk chair or wooden Windsor chair
- Wrought iron desk lamp
- Open wood shelving for books and display
- Natural fiber rug under desk area

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Deep-seated, worn leather or natural linen, chunky wood legs or no legs (floor-sitting)
- **Coffee table**: Live-edge wood slab, reclaimed wood plank, or iron-frame with wood top
- **Dining table**: Farmhouse table in solid wood — pine, oak, or reclaimed
- **Lighting**: Wrought iron chandeliers, cage pendants, Edison-bulb fixtures, lantern sconces
- **Rug**: Jute, sisal, or flat-weave wool in earth tones — layered over hardwood

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO embrace imperfection — knots, grain variations, patina, and wear marks add character
- DO mix natural materials — wood + stone + iron + natural fiber in the same room
- DO use warm, low-temperature lighting (2200K) for authentic rustic ambiance
- DO include handmade or artisanal objects — pottery, woven baskets, hand-forged hardware
- DO layer textures — rough wood against smooth stone against woven textile
- DON'T use shiny or polished metals (chrome, polished nickel) — they break the rustic feel
- DON'T use synthetic materials that imitate natural ones (faux stone, vinyl "wood")
- DON'T over-theme — avoid going full "log cabin" unless that's the actual context
- DON'T ignore comfort — rustic is warm and lived-in, not rough and uncomfortable

## Common Blends
- **Rustic + Modern**: "Industrial rustic" — reclaimed wood with metal frames, Edison bulbs, concrete accents. Clean lines but warm materials.
- **Rustic + Cozy**: Natural amplification — more textiles, warmer tones, deeper seating, additional layering. The warmest version of rustic.
- **Rustic + Scandinavian**: "Nordic cabin" — lighter woods (pine, birch), simpler forms, cleaner lines, but same natural materials and handcraft emphasis.
- **Rustic + Bohemian**: "Collected cabin" — kilim rugs on wood floors, mixed global textiles, plants in handmade pottery, eclectic art on wood walls.
