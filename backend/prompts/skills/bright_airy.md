# Bright & Airy Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: White/off-white walls (LRV 80+), light-toned wood (ash, birch, bleached oak), pale soft accents
- **Light**: Maximize natural light — sheer curtains only, no heavy window treatments blocking light
- **Furniture**: Minimal footprint, visible legs, transparent or glass elements, light upholstery
- **Materials**: Light-toned wood (ash, birch, bleached oak), glass, linen, cotton, light metals (brushed nickel, white)
- **Lighting**: Cool-white supplementary lighting (3500-4000K), large fixtures that don't block sightlines
- **Layout**: Open sightlines, furniture pulled away from walls where possible, visual continuity between zones

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Light-colored sofa (ivory, oatmeal, pale gray) with slim profile and visible legs
- Glass or acrylic coffee table to maintain sightlines
- Sheer white linen curtains floor-to-ceiling (hang rod 4-6" above frame for height illusion)
- Mirrors strategically placed opposite or adjacent to windows
- Keep floor visible — smaller or transparent furniture pieces

### Bedroom
- White or light linen bedding, minimal layering
- Light wood bed frame with visible legs (no heavy upholstered frames)
- Sheer curtains paired with light roller shades for privacy
- Wall-mounted shelves instead of bulky nightstands
- Light wood or white dresser, avoid dark heavy furniture

### Kitchen
- White or light-colored cabinetry
- Light countertops (white quartz, light marble, butcher block)
- Glass-front upper cabinets or open shelving
- Under-cabinet LED lighting (4000K) for bright task areas
- Large pendant over island in glass or white material

### Home Office
- White or light wood desk
- Natural light as primary light source — desk facing or perpendicular to window
- Sheer curtains to diffuse harsh direct sun without blocking light
- Light-colored ergonomic chair
- Minimal accessories — clean desktop

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Slim profile, light upholstery (linen, cotton), exposed light wood or metal legs
- **Coffee table**: Glass top, acrylic, or light wood — transparency is key
- **Dining table**: Light wood (ash, maple) or white, slim legs
- **Lighting**: Oversized paper/fabric pendants, slim brass sconces, glass globe fixtures
- **Rug**: Natural fiber (jute, sisal) or light-colored flat-weave, keeps visual openness

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO maximize natural light — remove or replace heavy curtains with sheers
- DO use mirrors to amplify light and create depth
- DO keep furniture legs visible to show more floor (raises perceived space)
- DO use consistent flooring throughout connected spaces for visual flow
- DO hang curtain rods high and wide (above frame, beyond edges) for taller/wider window illusion
- DON'T use dark, heavy furniture that visually weighs down the space
- DON'T block natural light paths with tall furniture near windows
- DON'T over-accessorize — visual clutter works against the airy feel
- DON'T use warm lighting below 3000K as the primary source (conflicts with bright-airy goal)

## Common Blends
- **Bright & Airy + Scandinavian**: Natural partners — blonde wood, white base, plants, clean lines. Add hygge textiles (sheepskin, knit) for warmth without heaviness.
- **Bright & Airy + Modern**: Glass, metal, and white palette with architectural forms. Crisper and more structured than the base style.
- **Bright & Airy + Coastal**: Blue-white palette, natural fibers (rattan, jute), driftwood accents, ocean-inspired art. Light and relaxed.
- **Bright & Airy + Minimalist**: Near-overlap — the key difference is bright-airy emphasizes light and openness while minimalist emphasizes intentional reduction.
