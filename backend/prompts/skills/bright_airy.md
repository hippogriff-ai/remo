# Bright & Airy Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: White/off-white walls (LRV 80+), light-toned wood (ash, birch, bleached oak), pale soft accents
- **Light**: Maximize natural light — sheer curtains only, no heavy window treatments blocking light
- **Furniture**: Minimal footprint, visible legs, transparent or glass elements, light upholstery
- **Materials**: Light-toned wood (ash, birch, bleached oak), glass, linen, cotton, light metals (brushed nickel, white)
- **Lighting**: Cool-white supplementary lighting (3500-4000K), large fixtures that don't block sightlines
- **Layout**: Open sightlines, furniture pulled away from walls where possible, visual continuity between zones

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Light-colored sofa (ivory, oatmeal, pale gray) with slim profile and visible legs
- Transparent coffee table (glass, acrylic) or light wood to maintain sightlines
- Sheer white linen curtains floor-to-ceiling (hang rod 4-6" above frame for height illusion)
- Mirrors strategically placed opposite or adjacent to windows
- Keep floor visible — smaller or transparent furniture pieces

### Bedroom
- White or light linen bedding, minimal layering
- Light wood bed frame with visible legs (no heavy upholstered frames)
- Sheer curtains paired with light roller shades for privacy
- Light wood or white nightstand, avoid dark heavy pieces
- Light wood or white dresser — maintain the airy palette

### Kitchen
- White or light-colored cabinetry
- Light countertops (white quartz, light marble, butcher block)
- Glass-front upper cabinets or open shelving
- Under-cabinet LED lighting (4000K) for bright task areas
- Large pendant over island in glass or white material

### Home Office
- White or light wood desk
- Natural light as primary light source — desk facing or perpendicular to window
- Sheer curtains to diffuse harsh direct sun without blocking light
- Light-colored ergonomic chair
- Minimal accessories — clean desktop

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Slim profile, light upholstery (linen, cotton), exposed light wood or metal legs
- **Coffee table**: Glass top, acrylic, or light wood — transparency is key
- **Dining table**: Light wood (ash, maple) or white, slim legs
- **Lighting**: Oversized paper/fabric pendants, slim brass sconces, glass globe fixtures
- **Rug**: Natural fiber (jute, sisal) or light-colored flat-weave, keeps visual openness

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO maximize natural light — remove or replace heavy curtains with sheers
- DO use mirrors to amplify light and create depth
- DO keep furniture legs visible to show more floor (raises perceived space)
- DO hang curtain rods high and wide (above frame, beyond edges) for taller/wider window illusion
- DON'T use dark, heavy furniture that visually weighs down the space
- DON'T block natural light paths with tall furniture near windows
- DON'T over-accessorize — visual clutter works against the airy feel
- DON'T use warm lighting below 3000K as the primary source (conflicts with bright-airy goal)

## Common Blends
- **Bright & Airy + Scandinavian**: Natural partners — blonde wood, white base, plants, clean lines. Add hygge textiles (sheepskin, knit) for warmth without heaviness.
- **Bright & Airy + Modern**: Glass, metal, and white palette with architectural forms. Crisper and more structured than the base style.
- **Bright & Airy + Coastal**: Blue-white palette, natural fibers (rattan, jute), driftwood accents, ocean-inspired art. Light and relaxed.
- **Bright & Airy + Minimalist**: Near-overlap — the key difference is bright-airy emphasizes light and openness while minimalist emphasizes intentional reduction.

## Probing Steps
After loading this skill, ask these style-specific questions (pick 2-3 most relevant to the room):
1. "How much natural light does the room currently get — is this about enhancing what's there or creating the illusion?"
2. "Are you open to replacing any existing heavy/dark furniture to achieve the bright look?"
3. "Do you prefer crisp white or softer warm whites (cream, ivory)?"
4. "Would you like some subtle color accents (sage, pale blue) or keep it strictly neutral?"

## Example Partial Brief

**User said:** "I want everything light and open — maximize the natural light, no heavy curtains, the room should glow."
