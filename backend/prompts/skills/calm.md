# Calm & Serene Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: Cool muted tones — soft blues, sage, lavender, warm gray, seafoam, dusty rose
- **Pattern**: Minimal — solid colors dominate, subtle tone-on-tone texture patterns only
- **Storage**: Closed — no visual clutter, everything has a hidden home
- **Materials**: Sound-absorbing — plush rugs, heavy curtains, upholstered furniture, acoustic panels as art
- **Biophilic**: Essential — plants, natural materials, water features, nature-inspired art
- **Lighting**: Diffused — no harsh direct overhead, layered soft sources, dimmable throughout
- **Layout**: Prospect-refuge balance — protected seating with forward views, clear sightlines to entries

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Low, deep seating in muted upholstery (sage, soft blue, warm gray)
- Thick, sound-absorbing area rug in a solid muted tone
- Floor-to-ceiling curtains in heavy linen — both privacy and acoustic buffer
- Diffused lighting: paper lantern pendants, fabric shade floor lamps, indirect LED cove lighting
- 2-3 large plants (snake plant, fiddle leaf fig, peace lily) as primary decor
- No TV visible from primary seating if possible (cabinet or rotating mount)

### Bedroom
- All-cotton or linen bedding in muted tones (soft blue, sage, lavender)
- Blackout curtains behind sheer layers — full light control
- No overhead lighting — bedside lamps only (2200-2700K), dimmable
- White noise capability (fan, dedicated machine)
- Minimal nightstand contents — closed drawer storage
- Plants that improve air quality (snake plant, pothos)

### Home Office
- Acoustic treatment: rug under desk, curtains, upholstered chair, wall panel behind monitor
- Desk facing into room with view of door (prospect-refuge for focus)
- Task lamp with warm-neutral light (3000K) — not harsh cool white
- Nature view from desk if possible; nature art if not
- Cable management: all cords hidden for visual calm

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Low profile, deep seat, soft muted upholstery (boucle, linen), rounded forms preferred
- **Coffee table**: Rounded edges (reduces visual tension), solid wood or stone, muted finish
- **Storage**: Closed credenzas, built-in shelving with doors, baskets for open shelves
- **Lighting**: Paper/fabric shade pendants, indirect cove LEDs, candle clusters, dimmable everything
- **Rug**: Thick pile in a single muted color, large enough to anchor the full seating area

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO prioritize sound absorption — rugs, curtains, upholstered surfaces reduce ambient noise
- DO use curves and rounded forms — they activate reward centers, reduce perceived tension
- DO include at least 2-3 plants for biophilic benefit (air quality + visual calm)
- DO layer lighting with all-dimmable sources (no bright-or-off switches)
- DO use closed storage to eliminate visual noise
- DON'T use bold patterns or high-contrast combinations (creates visual stimulation)
- DON'T leave surfaces cluttered — every visible object adds cognitive load
- DON'T use harsh overhead lighting or cool-white bulbs (>3500K) in relaxation spaces
- DON'T introduce sharp angular furniture in primary rest areas

## Common Blends
- **Calm + Scandinavian**: Very compatible — pale wood, muted palette, functional simplicity, plants. Scandi adds warmth via hygge textiles.
- **Calm + Minimalist**: Overlap in clutter-free philosophy. Calm adds color (muted) and texture (soft) where minimalist tends toward monochrome and hard surfaces.
- **Calm + Modern**: Clean lines of modern with the soft palette and sound-absorbing materials of calm. Architectural lighting becomes diffused architectural lighting.
- **Calm + Cozy**: "Serene cozy" — warm muted tones (sage, dusty rose) with layered soft textiles. Warmer than pure calm but less intense than full cozy.

## Probing Steps
After loading this skill, ask these style-specific questions (pick 2-3 most relevant to the room):
1. "Is noise a concern? Sound-absorbing materials can make a big difference."
2. "Do you want a cool-toned calm (blues, grays) or a warm-toned calm (sage, dusty rose)?"
3. "How important are plants — do you want greenery as a main element or just subtle touches?"
4. "Would you like to minimize screen visibility in relaxation areas (TV cabinet, hidden monitor)?"

## Example Partial Brief
