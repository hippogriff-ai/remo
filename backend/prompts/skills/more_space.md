# More Space & Openness Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: Light tones expand perceived space — coordinate shade/LRV with your style palette; keep consistent across connected spaces
- **Mirrors**: Strategic placement opposite windows to amplify light and perceived depth
- **Furniture**: Transparent/glass where possible, multi-functional, visible legs (shows floor space)
- **Flooring**: Consistent throughout connected areas — visual continuity expands perceived space
- **Pieces**: Multi-functional — storage ottomans, lift-top coffee tables, murphy beds, nesting tables
- **Circulation**: Improved paths (minimum 36" / 91cm) — clear traffic flow is non-negotiable
- **Vertical**: Uplighting and tall elements to raise perceived ceiling height

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Sofa with visible legs (not a skirted sofa) — shows floor, room feels larger
- Glass or acrylic coffee table — visual pass-through
- Wall-mounted TV and floating shelves — free up floor area
- One large mirror opposite or adjacent to primary window
- Area rug that blends with flooring for visual continuity
- Multi-functional furniture: storage ottoman, nesting side tables, console with drawers
- Keep traffic paths clear: 36"+ between furniture pieces

### Bedroom
- Bed with visible legs or platform bed with under-bed storage
- Wall-mounted nightstands or floating shelves — no floor-standing bedside tables
- Built-in closet system (maximize vertical space, eliminate freestanding wardrobe)
- Mirror on closet door or wall opposite window
- One overhead light + wall-mounted reading lights (no floor lamps eating floor space)

### Kitchen
- Light cabinetry (white, cream, pale wood) to expand visual space
- Open shelving on upper walls (reduces visual weight vs. closed upper cabinets)
- Under-cabinet LED lighting for brightness without overhead bulk
- Consistent countertop material — no visual breaks
- Compact/multi-functional appliances
- If possible: extend one material (countertop or backsplash) across the full wall for continuity

### Home Office
- Wall-mounted or fold-down desk to reclaim floor when not working
- Vertical storage: wall-mounted shelves, pegboard, magnetic strips
- Under-desk cable management (no visual clutter on floor)
- Task lamp that clamps to desk (no floor lamp)

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Apartment-scale (72-80"), visible legs, light upholstery, no bulky arms
- **Coffee table**: Glass, acrylic, or nesting tables — visual transparency
- **Dining table**: Extendable/folding — seats 2 daily, expands for guests
- **Storage**: Wall-mounted floating shelves, built-in closet systems, storage ottomans, under-bed drawers
- **Lighting**: Flush-mount or recessed (no hanging fixtures eating head clearance), wall sconces, uplighting

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO use consistent flooring across connected rooms — visual continuity makes spaces feel larger
- DO show floor — furniture with legs, minimal rugs, clear paths
- DO use mirrors to double perceived depth (opposite or adjacent to windows)
- DO choose multi-functional pieces — every item should earn its square footage
- DO use vertical space — wall-mounted storage, tall bookcases, hang curtains at ceiling height
- DO use floor-to-ceiling curtains (even on standard windows) to increase perceived height
- DO paint ceiling slightly lighter than walls (or same white) for height
- DON'T block natural light paths — keep windows unobstructed (see your style guide for curtain specifics)
- DON'T use dark colors on walls in small rooms (they absorb light and close in)
- DON'T place large furniture across traffic paths — circulation is the first priority
- DON'T use too many small items (multiple small tables, scattered decor) — fewer larger pieces feel less cluttered
- DON'T hang art at eye level if ceiling is low — raise it to draw the eye up

## Common Blends
`more_space` is **orthogonal** — it can be applied with any other style skill. It provides spatial optimization techniques that enhance any aesthetic:

- **More Space + Cozy**: Warm tones and textiles in a compact, well-organized space. Use wall-mounted warm lighting instead of floor lamps. Vertical textile displays (wall hangings) instead of layered surfaces.
- **More Space + Modern**: Natural fit — modern's clean lines and negative space align with space optimization. Add glass/acrylic furniture and wall-mounted storage.
- **More Space + Scandinavian**: Excellent match — both value light, simplicity, and function. Blonde wood furniture with visible legs, white walls, strategic mirrors.
- **More Space + Bohemian**: Challenging but possible — wall-mounted plant shelves, vertical textile displays, nesting tables, multi-functional seating (storage poufs). Edit the collection but keep the spirit.

## Probing Steps
After loading this skill, ask these style-specific questions (pick 2-3 most relevant to the room):
1. "What feels most cramped — is it floor space, visual clutter, or low ceilings?"
2. "Are you open to multi-functional furniture (storage ottomans, fold-down desks, murphy beds)?"
3. "Would you remove any existing furniture to gain space, or is every piece needed?"
4. "Is there a specific traffic path that feels blocked or tight?"

## Example Partial Brief

**User said:** "This room feels really cramped — I need to make it feel bigger and more functional without losing any seating."
