# Cozy & Warm Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: Warm tones — amber, terracotta, warm wood tones (walnut, teak), deep caramel, burnt sienna
- **Textiles**: Layered — knit throws, plush area rugs, velvet upholstery, faux fur accents, chunky wool blankets
- **Lighting**: Low warm lighting (2200-2700K), table lamps with warm-toned shades, candle-like fixtures, dimmer switches essential
- **Furniture**: Intimate-scale, deep-seated, enveloping forms — oversized armchairs, deep sofas with soft cushions, low coffee tables
- **Materials**: Natural — wool, linen, solid wood, leather (aged/distressed preferred), ceramic, woven rattan
- **Layout**: Refuge-dominant — furniture arranged inward, back protection on primary seating, conversation-distance grouping (3.5-8ft)

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Anchor with a deep, oversized sofa (min 90" for true cozy scale) in a warm neutral or rich earth tone
- Layer at least 3 throw textiles at different heights (sofa throw, chair blanket, ottoman throw)
- Area rug should extend under all front legs of seating — never floating
- Table lamps at 3+ locations; avoid overhead-only lighting which kills warmth
- Fireplace or faux fireplace as focal point if possible

### Bedroom
- Heavy, plush bedding — duvet + 2 throw blankets + decorative pillows in varying textures
- Warm wood headboard or upholstered headboard in velvet/linen
- Bedside table lamps with warm shades (not overhead light)
- Blackout curtains in a warm, heavy fabric — layered with sheer inner curtains
- Small reading nook corner if space allows (accent chair + floor lamp + throw)

### Home Office
- Warm wood desk (avoid glass or white laminate)
- Upholstered desk chair in leather or warm fabric
- Warm task lamp (brass or warm metal, 2700K bulb)
- Textile wall hanging or bookshelf backdrop for visual warmth
- Area rug under desk zone

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Deep-seated (24"+ seat depth), soft cushion fill, warm upholstery (boucle, velvet, linen)
- **Coffee table**: Solid wood (walnut, oak), rounded edges preferred for cozy feel
- **Accent chair**: Oversized, enveloping — wing chair, swivel chair, or papasan style
- **Lighting**: Brass/copper table lamps, warm-shade floor lamps, string lights for accent warmth
- **Rug**: Plush pile (shag, wool loop, high-pile), warm tones, large enough to anchor seating area

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO layer textures at multiple heights and surfaces
- DO use warm metals (brass, copper, gold) over cool metals (chrome, nickel)
- DO create pools of warm light rather than uniform illumination
- DO include at least one biophilic element (indoor plant, natural wood, nature art)
- DON'T use cool-white lighting (no >3000K in main living areas)
- DON'T leave large surfaces bare — walls, floors, and furniture all benefit from textile layers
- DON'T use glass or transparent furniture (breaks the intimacy)
- DON'T over-match — varied warm tones create depth; a single shade feels flat

## Common Blends
- **Cozy + Modern**: Warm tones with clean lines — boucle sofa, walnut mid-century tables, warm brass lighting. Keep the warmth but edit the clutter.
- **Cozy + Scandinavian**: Hygge overlap — pale wood + warm textiles, candle clusters, sheepskin throws. Lighter palette but same intimacy.
- **Cozy + Rustic**: Natural amplification — distressed wood, woven textiles, wrought iron, earth tones. More texture, less polish.
- **Cozy + Bohemian**: Maximalist warmth — kilim rugs, global textiles, warm tones + jewel accents, plants everywhere, layered everything.
