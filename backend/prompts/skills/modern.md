# Modern & Clean Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: Neutral base (whites, warm grays, black) with 1-2 strategic color accents
- **Lines**: Clean geometric forms, straight edges, visible structure
- **Furniture**: Sleek with exposed legs, low profiles, architectural silhouettes
- **Materials**: Glass, steel, concrete, engineered stone, smooth leather, polished surfaces
- **Lighting**: Architectural — recessed downlights, linear LED strips, geometric pendants, track lighting
- **Layout**: Open plan with negative space as a design element, defined zones through furniture placement not walls

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Low-profile sofa (30-32" back height) with clean lines and exposed metal or wood legs
- Glass or marble coffee table with geometric frame
- Single statement art piece (large scale, abstract or graphic)
- Recessed lighting base + 1-2 architectural floor lamps
- Rug: flat-weave, solid color or subtle geometric pattern

### Bedroom
- Platform bed with integrated nightstands or floating shelves
- Minimal bedding layers — crisp duvet, 2-4 structured pillows
- Built-in or wall-mounted storage (no freestanding dressers if possible)
- Linear LED strip behind headboard or under bed for ambient glow
- Blackout roller shades (clean profile) rather than heavy curtains

### Kitchen
- Handle-less cabinetry (push-to-open or integrated pulls)
- Waterfall edge countertop in quartz or engineered stone
- Pendant lighting over island — geometric, matte metal
- Open shelving for curated display; closed for bulk storage

### Home Office
- Minimalist desk — thin profile, metal frame, clean surface
- Ergonomic chair in black mesh or leather
- Cable management: all cords hidden
- Wall-mounted monitor arm for floating screen look
- Task lamp: adjustable arm, matte black or brushed metal

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Low-profile, track arms, exposed legs (metal or tapered wood), neutral upholstery
- **Coffee table**: Glass top with metal base, or solid marble slab on geometric legs
- **Dining table**: Engineered stone or walnut top, metal base, rectangular
- **Lighting**: Sputnik chandelier, arc floor lamp, linear pendants, recessed spots
- **Rug**: Flat-weave wool or cotton, solid or subtle geometric, monochromatic

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO leave negative space — not every wall and surface needs something on it
- DO use one bold accent color against the neutral base (emerald, navy, rust)
- DO mix matte and polished finishes for visual depth (matte walls + polished metal fixtures)
- DO choose architectural lighting that serves as a design element
- DON'T add decorative clutter — every visible object should be intentional
- DON'T use heavy, ornate curtains or traditional furniture forms
- DON'T over-warm — maintain some visual coolness for authenticity
- DON'T mix too many accent colors — limit to 1-2 strong ones

## Common Blends
- **Modern + Cozy**: "Warm modern" — clean lines with warm wood tones, boucle or textured upholstery, brass accents instead of chrome. Negative space preserved but surfaces softened.
- **Modern + Minimalist**: Near-identical but modern allows more color accents and decorative objects than pure minimalist. Keep the clean lines, add selective personality.
- **Modern + Scandinavian**: "Scandi-modern" — blonde wood instead of dark, warmer whites, plant life added. Clean lines shared; the Scandi influence softens the palette.
- **Modern + Luxurious**: "Glam modern" — marble, velvet accent pieces, gold/brass hardware, statement chandelier. Clean lines but richer materials and bolder accents.
