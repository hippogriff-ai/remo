# Scandinavian & Hygge Style Guide

## Core Parameters
- **Palette**: Pale neutral base — white, light gray, blonde wood (birch, pine, ash, light oak)
- **Textiles**: Hygge-inspired — sheepskin, knit throws, wool blankets, linen, cotton
- **Furniture**: Simple and functional — clean lines, no ornament, form follows function
- **Plants**: Primary decor — greenery adds life and color to the pale neutral base
- **Light**: Natural light maximized — sheer curtains, light-reflective surfaces, no heavy window treatments
- **Lighting**: Warm-white (2700-3000K) — candles as essential ambient element, pendant lights, floor lamps
- **Accessories**: Minimal — few but meaningful, handmade preferred (ceramics, wood objects, woven items)

## Room-Type Adaptations

### Living Room
- Light wood floor (birch, pine, or light oak) — visible grain, matte finish
- Neutral sofa (light gray, oatmeal, white) with clean lines and wood legs
- Sheepskin throw draped on sofa or accent chair
- Coffee table in light wood — simple, functional, Scandinavian-designed
- 3-5 plants at varying heights
- Candle clusters as ambient light source
- One curated shelf or surface — ceramics, books, one plant

### Bedroom
- Light wood bed frame — simple, no headboard or minimal slatted headboard
- White linen bedding with one knit throw folded at foot
- Sheepskin beside the bed as a tactile element
- Bedside pendant lights or wall-mounted reading lamps (warm white)
- Plants on windowsill
- Minimal nightstand — one object (book, candle, small plant)

### Kitchen
- White or light wood cabinetry with minimal hardware (leather pulls or integrated)
- Butcher block or light wood countertop
- Open shelving with curated dishware (simple white ceramics)
- Pendant light over table or island — paper globe or simple wood/metal
- Herbs in pots as functional decor
- Tea towels in muted stripes or solid linen

### Home Office
- Light wood desk — birch or pine, simple trestle or A-frame design
- White or light gray walls, no visual distractions
- One plant on desk, one on shelf
- Pendant or desk lamp — simple, functional design
- Cork or linen pinboard for organization
- Books and supplies in closed or basket storage

## Furniture Recommendations
- **Sofa**: Clean lines, track arms, light wood legs, neutral upholstery (gray, oatmeal, white)
- **Coffee table**: Light wood, round or organic shape preferred, simple legs
- **Dining table**: Birch or oak, round preferred for sociability, seats 4-6
- **Lighting**: Paper globe pendant, brass/wood floor lamp, candle holders (brass or ceramic)
- **Rug**: Flat-weave wool or cotton in light gray, white, or muted stripe

## Do's and Don'ts
- DO maximize natural light — it's the foundation of Scandi design
- DO use candles liberally — hygge depends on warm, flickering ambient light
- DO choose function over decoration — every piece should serve a purpose
- DO include plants — they provide the primary color and life in a neutral palette
- DO embrace negative space — not every surface needs something on it
- DO use natural, honest materials — real wood, wool, linen, ceramics (not imitations)
- DON'T use dark, heavy furniture — it contradicts the light, airy Scandi base
- DON'T over-decorate — Scandi accessories are few, meaningful, and often handmade
- DON'T use artificial or plasticky materials — authenticity in materials is central
- DON'T use cool-white lighting (>3000K) — warmth is essential for hygge

## Common Blends
- **Scandinavian + Cozy**: "Hygge amplified" — more textiles, warmer tones, deeper layering. Same clean lines but with sheepskin, knit, and wool everywhere.
- **Scandinavian + Minimalist**: "Nordic minimal" — the sparest version of Scandi. Fewer objects, more white, less textile layering. Function is paramount.
- **Scandinavian + Modern**: "Scandi-modern" — shared clean lines, but warmer materials than pure modern. Blonde wood replaces metal; linen replaces leather.
- **Scandinavian + Bright & Airy**: Natural partners — both maximize light and use pale palettes. Scandi adds warmth through textiles and candles that bright-airy may lack.

## Probing Steps
After loading this skill, ask these style-specific questions (pick 2-3 most relevant to the room):
1. "Do you want the full hygge experience (candles, sheepskin, knits) or a sleeker Nordic look?"
2. "How plant-heavy should it be — a few accent plants or greenery as the main decor?"
3. "Do you prefer all-white walls or some warmth (light gray, soft wood paneling)?"
4. "Are you drawn to round organic shapes or straighter clean lines for furniture?"

## Example Partial Brief
