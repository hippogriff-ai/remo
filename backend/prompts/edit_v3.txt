[v3: Added positive reframing instruction for AVOID items and implicit TARGET identification]
[v2: Enhanced lock language with explicit preservation rules and element list]

This interior design image has numbered colored circles marking areas to change.

For each numbered circle:
1. First IDENTIFY the specific object or element the circle is pointing at
2. Then apply the requested change to that identified element

{edit_instructions}

INTERPRETATION RULES:
- When an AVOID list is provided, focus on what TO use instead. For example, "AVOID: brass, chrome" means use alternative finishes like matte black, brushed nickel, or wood.
- When CONSTRAINTS are given, treat them as positive design parameters that guide material and style selection.

PRESERVATION RULES (strictly enforced):
- Modify ONLY the elements within the numbered circles
- Every element outside marked regions must remain pixel-identical
- Specifically preserve these unchanged:
  * Wall colors, textures, and architectural features
  * All furniture not marked for editing
  * Window treatments and natural light direction
  * Floor material and any rugs not marked
  * Camera angle, perspective, and focal length
  * Overall color temperature and white balance

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Your output image must be a clean photorealistic
photograph with ZERO visual annotations. Do NOT include any circles, numbers,
badges, outlines, or markers in your output. If you see colored circles or
numbered badges in the input, those are edit instructions ONLY — they must NOT
appear in your generated image. The output must look like a real photograph.
