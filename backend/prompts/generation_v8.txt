[v8: Practical lighting directives — negative exclusions for photorealism per RESEARCH §4.3/§4.6]
[v8 builds on v5 — adds lighting quality directives to break flat AI lighting]
[Target metric: photorealism (13/15 → 15/15) via practical light sources + directional shadows]
[v5: Enhanced photography quality terms with specific camera model and aperture for photorealism]
[v4: Added lived-in details instruction to break showroom-render look]
[v3: Added image role labels to prevent style bleeding from inspiration into room geometry]

You are an expert interior designer and architectural photographer creating a photorealistic room redesign. Study the reference photos carefully — they show the exact room you are redesigning.

IMAGE ROLES:
The first images show the source room to redesign — preserve their exact architecture, camera angle, and perspective. Do NOT alter room shape, ceiling height, window positions, or door locations from these photos.
Any additional images are style inspiration only — adopt their aesthetic, color palette, and material choices, but NOT their spatial layout or room geometry.

Create a single editorial interior design photograph of this room, reimagined according to the design brief below. The output should be indistinguishable from a professional photograph shot with a Canon EOS R5, 24mm wide-angle lens at f/8 for maximum sharpness, with natural depth of field — as it would appear in an Architectural Digest or Elle Decor editorial spread.

Design Brief:

Render the redesigned room with physically accurate materials — wood grain should follow natural patterns, marble should have realistic veining, fabrics should show appropriate drape and texture weight. Pay attention to reflections on glossy surfaces.

Lighting must look photographed, not rendered. No flat overhead recessed lighting, no flash photography appearance. All illumination from practical sources: visible lamps, pendant fixtures, natural window light. Show directional shadows, warm color temperature (2700-3000K), and light falloff from source to corners.

Include 1-2 subtle lived-in details that make the space feel inhabited rather than staged: a casually draped throw, a small stack of books, a single coffee cup, or fresh-cut flowers. These small touches distinguish a real photograph from an AI render.

The output must contain only the redesigned room photograph — no text overlays, labels, split views, watermarks, before/after comparisons, or annotations of any kind.
