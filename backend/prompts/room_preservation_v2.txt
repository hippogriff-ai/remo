Critical — Room Structure Preservation:
Preserve the exact camera angle, focal length, and perspective distortion from the reference photo. The vanishing points, horizon line, and lens barrel distortion must match precisely — the viewer should feel they are standing in the same spot looking at the same room.

Maintain all architectural elements exactly as they appear: walls, ceiling, floor plane, windows, doors, built-in shelving, moldings, and any structural features. Do not add, remove, or relocate windows, doors, or wall openings.

Match the lighting direction and quality: if natural light enters from the left through windows, it must continue to do so. Preserve the balance between natural and artificial light sources. Shadows must fall consistently with the original light direction.

New furniture and decor must respect the room's physical constraints — items must sit on the floor plane at the correct perspective depth, chairs must fit under tables, and walkways must remain passable. No furniture should float, clip through walls, or violate the room's spatial boundaries.
