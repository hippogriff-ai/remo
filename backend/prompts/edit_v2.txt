[v2: Enhanced lock language with explicit preservation rules and element list]

This interior design image has numbered colored circles marking areas to change.
Each numbered circle indicates a specific region and edit instruction:

{edit_instructions}

PRESERVATION RULES (strictly enforced):
- Modify ONLY the elements within the numbered circles
- Every element outside marked regions must remain pixel-identical
- Specifically preserve these unchanged:
  * Wall colors, textures, and architectural features
  * All furniture not marked for editing
  * Window treatments and natural light direction
  * Floor material and any rugs not marked
  * Camera angle, perspective, and focal length
  * Overall color temperature and white balance

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Your output image must be a clean photorealistic
photograph with ZERO visual annotations. Do NOT include any circles, numbers,
badges, outlines, or markers in your output. If you see colored circles or
numbered badges in the input, those are edit instructions ONLY — they must NOT
appear in your generated image. The output must look like a real photograph.
