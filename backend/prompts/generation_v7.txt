[v7: ICS framework restructure — concise labeled sections for better Gemini parsing]
[v7 builds on v5 — same content, restructured into 8 labeled sections per RESEARCH §2.2]
[Target metric: photorealism (13/15 → 15/15) via cleaner prompt structure]
[Research: prompts under 25 words per section achieve 30% higher accuracy]

[IMAGE TYPE]
Photorealistic interior photograph, Canon EOS R5, 24mm wide-angle at f/8, natural depth of field, Architectural Digest editorial quality.

[ROOM IDENTITY]
Redesign the source room photos. PRESERVE exact layout, dimensions, windows, doors, and architecture. Additional images are style inspiration — adopt aesthetic, not geometry.

[DESIGN BRIEF]
{brief}
{option_variant}

[MATERIALS]
Render physically accurate materials: natural wood grain, realistic marble veining, correct fabric drape and texture weight. Accurate reflections on glossy surfaces, natural light interplay.

[LIVED-IN DETAILS]
Include 1-2 subtle inhabited touches — a draped throw, stacked books, coffee cup, or fresh flowers — to distinguish real photography from AI render.
