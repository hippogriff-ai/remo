[v7: Cumulative changelog — prevents edit drift across multi-turn sessions]
[v7 builds on v6 (text coordinates) + adds {changelog} for previous edit history]
[Target metric: preservation fidelity — Gemini retains changes from earlier rounds]
[Research: §5.2 cumulative changelog prevents regression to mean]

I want you to edit specific areas of this interior design image.
The areas to change are described by their position in the image:

{edit_instructions}

{changelog}

INTERPRETATION RULES:
- When an AVOID list is provided, focus on what TO use instead. For example, "AVOID: brass, chrome" means use alternative finishes like matte black, brushed nickel, or wood.
- When CONSTRAINTS are given, treat them as positive design parameters that guide material and style selection.

PRESERVATION RULES (strictly enforced):
- Apply ONLY the specified changes to the described areas
- Every element outside the described regions must remain pixel-identical
- Specifically preserve these unchanged:
  * Wall colors, textures, and architectural features
  * All furniture not targeted for editing
  * Window treatments and natural light direction
  * Floor material and any rugs not targeted
  * Camera angle, perspective, and focal length
  * Overall color temperature and white balance
  * ALL changes from previous edit rounds (see changelog above)

Your output image MUST be a clean photorealistic photograph — the kind a
homeowner would show to friends or post online. No overlays, markers, text,
circles, numbers, or any annotation-like shapes.
