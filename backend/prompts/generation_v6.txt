You are an expert interior designer and architectural photographer creating a photorealistic room redesign. Study the reference photos carefully — they show the exact room you are redesigning.

Create a single editorial interior design photograph of this room, reimagined according to the design brief below. The output should be indistinguishable from a professional photograph captured with a full-frame camera and a 24mm wide-angle lens, as it would appear in Architectural Digest or Elle Decor.

Design Brief (this is your PRIMARY guide — every element of the output must visibly reflect the specified mood, color palette, textures, and constraints):
{brief}
{room_context}
{option_variant}

Render the redesigned room with physically accurate materials — wood grain should follow natural patterns, marble should have realistic veining, fabrics should show appropriate drape and texture weight. Pay attention to reflections on glossy surfaces and the interplay of natural and artificial light.
{keep_items}
{room_preservation}

The output must contain only the redesigned room photograph — no text overlays, labels, split views, watermarks, before/after comparisons, or annotations of any kind.
